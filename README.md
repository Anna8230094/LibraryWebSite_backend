## ðŸš€ Custom Enhancements

In addition to the course implementation, I have made the following improvements:

âœ… **Swagger UI Integration** â€“ Added Swagger UI to document and test the REST API endpoints.  
âœ… **PostgreSQL Database** â€“ Configured the project to use PostgreSQL instead of MySQL for improved scalability and performance.
